# PrayerTime BD(Bangladesh Only) Chrome Extension

PrayerTime BD is a simple and easy-to-use Chrome extension that helps Muslims in Bangladesh keep track of their daily prayers. You can quickly see the time left until the next prayer and view all prayer times for today. I built this extension because I could not find any good tool for Bangladesh, and I wanted to see my next prayer time so I don't miss my prayers. Download PrayerTime BD and stay updated with your prayer times easily.
